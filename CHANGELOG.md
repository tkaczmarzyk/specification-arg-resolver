v2.14.0
=======
* added support for `jsonPaths` during generation of swagger documentation.
* fixed bugs related to swagger support:
  * fixed marking `headers` and `pathVars` parameters as required/non-required. From now all `pathVars` are marked as required and `headers` can be marked as required depending on controller method configuration.
  * fixed duplicated parameters when the same parameter was defined in spec and controller method (e.g. when we defined `firstName` parameter in our `@Spec` and also in `@RequestParam("firstName")`).
* added `OnTypeMismatch.IGNORE` which ignores specification containing mismatched parameter (except `spec = In.class` - in this specification only mismatched parameter values are ignored, but other ones which are valid are used to build a Specification).
  * For example, for the following endpoint:
    ```
    @RequestMapping(value = "/customers", params = { "id" })
    @ResponseBody
    public Object findById(
           @Spec(path = "id", params = "id", spec = Equal.class, onTypeMismatch = IGNORE) Specification<Customer> spec) {
    return customerRepo.findAll(spec);
    }
    ```
  * For request with mismatched `id` param (e.g. `?id=invalidId`) the whole specification will be ignored and all records from the database (without filtering) will be returned.
  * But for the following endpoint with `In.class` specification type:
    ```
    @RequestMapping(value = "/customers", params = { "id_in" })
    @ResponseBody
    public Object findByIdIn(
       @Spec(path = "id", params = "id_in", spec = In.class, paramSeparator = ",", onTypeMismatch = IGNORE) Specification<Customer> spec) {
			 return customerRepo.findAll(spec);
    }
    ```
  * For request with params `?id_in=1,2,invalidId` - only valid params will be taken into consideration (invalid params (not the whole specification) will be ignored)
  * For request with only invalid params `id_in=invalidId1,invalidId2` - an empty result will be returned as there are only invalid parameters (which are ignored).

v2.13.0
=======
* added Json request body support. This requires adding `gson` dependency to your project and has some limitations -- see json section of README.md for more details.

v2.12.1
=======
* Fixed bug in `SpecificationBuilder` that was creating doubled query conditions.
* Changed approach for resolving path variables when processing request.
* From now on, the controllers with global prefixes (configured using `org.springframework.web.servlet.config.annotation.PathMatchConfigurer`) should be properly handled:
  * For example, apps with following configuration are now supported:
    ```
    @Override
    public void configurePathMatch(PathMatchConfigurer configurer) {
      configurer.addPathPrefix("/api/{tenantId}", HandlerTypePredicate.forAnnotation(RestController.class));
    }
    ```
    Below spec will be properly resolved for request URI: `/api/123/findCustomers?firstName=John`
    ```
    @RestController
    public static class TestController {

        @GetMapping("/findCustomers")
        public List<Customer> findCustomersByFirstName(@And(value = {
        		@Spec(path = "tenantId", pathVar = "tenantId", spec = Equal.class),
        		@Spec(path = "firstName" param = "firstName", spec = Equal.class)
        }) Specification<Customer> spec) {
        	return customerRepository.findAll(spec);
        }
    }
    ```
   
v2.12.0
=======
* added support for `SpringDoc-OpenAPI` library -- parameters from specification will be shown in generated documentation

v2.11.0
=======
* replaced hibernate java persistence api dependency with java persistence api (`org.hibernate.javax.persistence` -> `javax.persistence`)
* Added `SpecificationBuilder` that allows creating specification apart from web layer.

  For example:
  * Let's assume the following specification:
    ```java
    @Join(path = "orders", alias = "o")
    @Spec(paths = "o.itemName", params = "orderItem", spec=Like.class)
    public interface CustomerByOrdersSpec implements Specification<Customer> {
    }
    ```
  * To create specifications outside the web layer, you can use the specification builder as follows:
    ```java
    Specification<Customer> spec = SpecificationBuilder.specification(CustomerByOrdersSpec.class) // good candidate for static import
          .withParams("orderItem", "Pizza")
          .build();            
    ```
  * It is recommended to use builder methods that corresponding to the type of argument passed to specification interface, e.g.:
    * For:
    ```java
    @Spec(paths = "o.itemName", params = "orderItem", spec=Like.class)
    ``` 
    you should use `withparams(<argName>, <values...>)` method. Each argument type (param, header, path variable) has its own corresponding builder method:
    * `params = <args>` => `withParams(<argName>, <values...>)`, single param argument can provide multiple values
    * `pathVars = <args>` => `withPathVar(<argName>, <value>)`, single pathVar argument can provide single value
    * `headers = <args>` => `withHeader(<argName>, <value>)`, single header argument can provide single value

  The builder exposes a method `withArg(<argName>, <values...>)` which allows defining a fallback value. It is recommended to use it unless you really know what you are doing.

v2.10.0
=======
* fixed bug with not evaluated join fetches in count queries (e.g. during pagination) -- from now on, join fetches in count queries are either skipped (if they are used solely for initialization of lazy collections) or converted to regular joins (if there is any filtering applied on the fetched part). See [issue 138](https://github.com/tkaczmarzyk/specification-arg-resolver/issues/138) for more details.
* added conversion support for `Timestamp`
* Added strict date format validation for `Date`, `Calendar` and `Timestamp` in `Converter` component.
  * Let's assume following specification definition:
    `@Spec(path = "startDate", params = "periodStart", spec = Equal.class, config = "yyyy-MM-dd")`
    * Previously, the request parameter values was parsed as follows:
      * `2022-11-28-unnecessary-additional-characters` was parsed to `2022-11-28` (if the date format was satisfied (checking from left to right) the next additional characters were ignored)
      * `28-11-2022` was parsed to invalid date (different from `2022-11-28`), order of specific parts of date was not validated.
      * `1-1-1` was parsed to invalid date (length of specific parts of date (year, month, day) was not validated)
    * From now on strict policy of date format validation is introduced. The Date has to be in specific format and of specific length.

v2.9.0
======
* Fixed the bug with redundant joins
* Added conversion support for `Calendar`

v2.8.0
======
* Added [spring cache](https://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/docs/2.6.x/reference/html/io.html#io.caching) support for custom specification interfaces. From now on, specifications generated from specification interfaces with the same params are equal and have the same `hashCode` value.
* Added support for join fetch aliases in specification paths.

  For example:
  ```java
  @RequestMapping(value = "/customers", params = { "orderedItemName" })
  @ResponseBody
  public Object findCustomersByOrderedItemName(
  		@JoinFetch(paths = "orders", alias = "o")
  		@Spec(path = "o.itemName", params = "orderedItemName", spec = Like.class)) Specification<Customer> spec) {
  	return customerRepository.findAll(spec, Sort.by("id"));
  }
  ```
  
  Please remember that:
  * Join fetch path can use only aliases of another fetch joins. 
  * Join path can use only aliases of another joins. 

  (see [README.md](README.md#join-fetch) for the details)
  
v2.7.0
======
* added support for resolving HTTP param name from a SpEL expression (via `@Spec.paramsInSpEL`)
* added support for resolving query arguments from HTTP request headers (via `@Spec.headers`)

v2.6.3
======
* supporting JDK17 (previous version threw exceptions on illegal reflection operations)

v2.6.2
======
* fixed pagination support for multi-level joins

v2.6.1
======
* fixed bug which caused invalid query to be created when multiple `@JoinFetch` annotations referenced the same alias

v2.6.0
======
* Added support for multi-level joins. 

  It's now possible to define multi-level join where each join can use aliases defined by previous joins (see [README.md](https://github.com/tkaczmarzyk/specification-arg-resolver/blob/master/README.md) for the details).
  
  For example:
  ```java
  @RequestMapping(value = "/findCustomersByOrderedItemTag")
  @PostMapping
  public Object findCustomersByOrderedItemTag(
  		@Join(path = "orders", alias = "o")
  		@Join(path = "o.tags", alias = "t")
  		@Spec(path = "t.name", params = "tag", spec = Equal.class) Specification<Customer> spec) {
  	return customerRepo.findAll(spec, Sort.by("id"));
  }
  ```
  
  Multi-level join fetch could be defined similarly to multi-level join.
 
  For example:
  ```java
  @RequestMapping(value = "/findCustomers")
  @PostMapping
  public Object findAllCustomers(
  		@JoinFetch(paths = "orders", alias = "o")
  		@JoinFetch(paths = "o.tags") Specification<Customer> spec) {
  	return customerRepo.findAll(spec).stream()
  			.map(this::mapToCustomerDto)
  			.collect(toList());

* Added support for [SpEL](https://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/5.2.7.RELEASE/spring-framework-reference/core.html#expressions) and [property placeholders](https://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/context/support/PropertySourcesPlaceholderConfigurer.html) in `@Spec` attributes: `constVal`, `defaultVal`.
 
  To enable SpEL support:
  * Configure `SpecificationArgumentResolver` by passing `AbstractApplicationContext` in constructor
  * Set `Spec` attribute `valueInSpEL` value to `true` 
  
   Configuration example:
   ```java
  	@Autowired
  	AbstractApplicationContext applicationContext;
  	
  	@Override
  	public void addArgumentResolvers(List<HandlerMethodArgumentResolver> argumentResolvers) {
  		argumentResolvers.add(new SpecificationArgumentResolver(applicationContext));
  	}
  ```

  Usage example of default value with property placeholder:

  ```java
  @RequestMapping(value = "/customers")
  @ResponseBody
  public Object findByLastName(
          @Spec(path = "id", params="lastName", defaultVal='${search.default-params.lastName}', valueInSpEL = true, spec = Equal.class) Specification<Customer> spec) {
  	
  	return customerRepo.findAll(spec);
  }
  ```

  application.properties
  ```properties
  search.default-params.lastName=Simpson
  ```

  Usage example of default value in [SpEL](https://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/5.2.7.RELEASE/spring-framework-reference/core.html#expressions):

  ```java
  @RequestMapping(value = "/customers")
  @ResponseBody
  public Object findCustomersWhoCameFromTheFuture(
          @Spec(path = "id", params="birthDate", defaultVal='#{T(java.time.LocalDate).now()}', valueInSpEL = true, spec = GreaterThanOrEqual.class) Specification<Customer> spec) {
  	
  	return customerRepo.findAll(spec);
  }
  ```

v2.5.0
======
* Added support for repeatable `@Join` and `@JoinFetch` annotations. `@Joins` annotation is now deprecated and it's going to be removed in the future.

    To specifying multiple different joins, repeated `@Join` annotation should be used: 
    ```java
    @RequestMapping(value = "/findBy", params = {""})
    public void findByBadgeTypeAndOrderItemName(
    		@Join(path = "orders", alias = "o", type = JoinType.LEFT)
    		@Join(path = "badges", alias = "b", type = JoinType.LEFT)
    		@Or({
    				@Spec(path = "o.itemName", params = "order", spec = Like.class),
    				@Spec(path = "b.badgeType", params = "badge", spec = Equal.class)
    		}) Specification<Customer> spec) {
    	return customerRepository.findAll(spec);
    }
    ```
    instead of using annotation container `@Joins`.

* Added support for enum in specs: `EqualIgnoreCase.class`, `NotEqualIgnoreCase.class`

v2.4.2
======
* Fixed `NullPointerException` for requests with missing params to an endpoint with specs which uses param separator. In previous versions `NullPointerException` had been thrown for requests with missing parameters. Now spec with `paramSeparator` attribute is skipped for request with missing params.

v2.4.1
======
* Added `distinct` (default: `true`) attribute to `JoinFetch` annotation. Attribute determines that query should be distinct or not.

v2.4.0
======
* Added conversion support for `UUID`, `OffsetDatetime`, `Instant`

* Added a fallback mechanism to `Converter` which uses converters registered in ConversionService. 
The `Converter` in case of missing converter for a given type tries to find a required converter in [Spring](https://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/core/convert/ConversionService.html) `ConversionService` , if `ConversionService` does not support required conversion `IllegalArgumentException` will be thrown. If the required converter is not present in `Converter` and `ConversionService` it could be defined and used as follows:

  ```java
  @Configuration
  @EnableJpaRepositories
  public class MyConfig implements WebMvcConfigurer {
   
      @Autowired
      ConversionService conversionService;
      
      @Override
      public void addArgumentResolvers(List<HandlerMethodArgumentResolver> argumentResolvers) {
          argumentResolvers.add(new SpecificationArgumentResolver(conversionService));
      }
  
      @Override
      public void addFormatters(FormatterRegistry registry) {
          registry.addConverter(new StringToAddressConverter());
      }
      
      public static class StringToAddressConverter implements Converter<String, Address> {
          @Override
          public Address convert(String rawAddress) {
              Address address = new Address();
              address.setStreet(rawAddress);
              return address;
          }
      }
  
      ...
  }
  ```

v2.3.0
======

* Added support for path variables with regexp. All patterns supported by [spring AntPathMatcher](https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/util/AntPathMatcher.html) are supported.
  
  For example:
  ```java
  @RequestMapping(value = "/pathVar/customers/{customerId:[0-9]+}")
  @ResponseBody
  public Object findById(
          @Spec(path = "id", pathVars = "customerId", spec = Equal.class) Specification<Customer> spec) {
  	
  	return customerRepo.findAll(spec);
  }
  ```

v2.2.2
======

* Fixed support for custom interfaces with complex inheritance tree. In previous versions, annotations: @Join, @JoinFetch, @Joins were supported only for the lowest interface in the inheritance tree. 

    Following example didn't work before fix:
     ```java
      @Join(path= "orders", alias = "o")
      @Spec(path="o.id", params="orderId", spec=Equal.class)
      public interface CommonFilter<T> extends Specification<T> { }
      
      public interface CustomerFilter extends CommonFilter<Customer> { }
     ```

v2.2.1
======

* `WebRequestQueryContext` has been improved to use an actual root query instance during path evaluation, rather than the one being cached before. **This should fix problems with count queries**
* Made `@JoinFetch` query distinct by default to keep the behavior in line with `@Join`.

v2.2.0
======

* Added support for passing multiple values as a single HTTP parameter. The new `paramSeparator` attribute of `@Spec` can be used to define the separator (e.g. comma). For example the following controller method:

  ```java
  @RequestMapping(value = "/customers", params = "genderIn")
  @ResponseBody
  public Object findCustomersByGender(
  	@Spec(path = "gender",
              params = "genderIn",
              paramSeparator = ",",
              spec = In.class) Specification<Customer> spec) {

  	return customerRepo.findAll(spec);
  }
  ```
  will handle `GET http://myhost/customers?gender=MALE,FEMALE` in exactly the same way as `GET http://myhost/customers?gender=MALE&gender=FEMALE`

v2.1.1
======

* fixed path variable resolving in environments where `HttpServletRequest.getPathInfo()` returns `null`

v2.1.0
======

* added possibility to define a default value for filtering, as a fallback when HTTP param is not present. For example this controller method: 
  ```java
  @RequestMapping("/users")
  public Object findByRole(
                    @Spec(path="role", spec=Equal.class, defaultVal="USER") Specification<User> spec) {
  
      return userRepo.findAll(spec);
  }
  ```
  
  Would handle request such as `GET /users` with the following query: `select u from Users u where u.role = 'USER'`.
* added new specifications: `StartingWith`, `EndingWith` and their case-insensitive counterparts
* added new specification negations: `NotIn`, `NotLike`

v2.0.0
======

* requires Java 8 + intended for Spring Boot 2.x
* fixed bug with repeated joins
* optimized joining: joins will not be performed if no filtering is applied on the join path
* fixed `OnTypeMismatch` behaviour for primitive `int` and `long` types
* under the hood improvements for better performance
* support for Java 8's `LocalDate` and `LocalDateTime`
* introduced `Between` specification which supports all `Comparable` types. Therefore `DateBetween` is now deprecated
* path variables are now supported! You can use new `pathVars` property of `@Spec` as follows:

  ```java
  @RequestMapping("/customers/{customerLastName}")
  @ResponseBody
  public Object findNotDeletedCustomersByFirstName(
                       @Spec(path = "lastName", pathVars = "customerLastName", spec=Equal.class) Specification<Customer> spec) {

    return repository.findAll(spec);
  }
  ```

  This will handle request `GET /customers/Simpson` as `select c from Customers c where c.lastName = 'Simpson'`.
* better conversion support for `float`, `double` and `BigDecimal`


v1.1.1
======

* bug fixes

v1.1.0
======

* added `NotEqual` and `NotEqualIgnoreCase` specs
* resolving annotations from parent interfaces, for example, consider the following interfaces:

  ```java
  @Spec(path = "deleted", constVal = "false", spec = Equal.class)
  public interface NotDeletedSpec extends Specification<Customer> {}

  @Spec(path = "firstName", spec = Equal.class)
  public interface FirstNameSpec extends NotDeletedSpec {}
  ```

  `FirstNameSpec` extends `NotDeletedSpec`, so their specifications will be combined with `and`, i.e. a controller method like this:

  ```java
  @RequestMapping("/customers")
  @ResponseBody
  public Object findNotDeletedCustomersByFirstName(FirstNameSpec spec) {
      
    return repository.findAll(spec);
  }
  ```

  will accept HTTP requests such as `GET /customers?firstName=Homer` and execute JPA queries such as `where firstName = 'Homer' and deleted = false`.
 

v1.0.0
======

* join support! It is now possible to filter by attributes of joined entities. For example:

  ```java
  @RequestMapping("/customers")
  @ResponseBody
  public Object findByOrders(
          @Join(path = "orders", alias = "o")
          @Spec(paths = "o.itemName", params = "orderItem", spec=Like.class)
          Specification<Customer> spec) {

      return repository.findAll(spec);
  }  
  ```
  
  Of course you can use `@Join` on annotated custom specification interfaces:

  ```java
  @Join(path = "orders", alias = "o")
  @Spec(paths = "o.itemName", params = "orderItem", spec=Like.class)
  public interface CustomerByOrdersSpec implements Specification<Customer> {
  }

  // ...

  @RequestMapping("/customers")
  @ResponseBody
  public Object findByOrders(
          CustomerByOrdersSpec spec) {

      return repository.findAll(spec);
  }

  ```

* `@Joins` annotation has been changed to take instances of `@Join` as `value` parameter (was `@JoinFetch`). `@JoinFetch` might be passed to `join` param of `@Joins` 

v0.9.2
======

* introduced `NotNull` specification

v0.9.1
======

* bumped dependencies to the latest Spring Boot version and JPA 2.1 API

v0.9.0
======

* added `EqualIgnoreCase` specification
* introduced `Null` specification which accepts a boolean HTTP param to dynamically add `is null` or `is not null` part to the query
* introduced `onTypeMismatch` property of `@Spec` to define whether an exception should be thrown or empty result returned when an invalid value is passed (e.g. a non numeric value while field type is `Integer`). Default behaviour is to return an empty result, which __is a breaking change__ (an exception was thrown in previous versions). Use `onTypeMismatch=EXCEPTION` to match old behaviour.

v0.8.0
======

* fixed stack overflow issue with annotated interfaces!
* added `GreaterThan`, `GreaterThanOrEqual`, `LessThan`, `LessThanOrEqual` specs
* `DateAfter`, `DateBefore` and their invlusive versions are now deprecated (use the above specs)

v0.7.0
======

* added `@JoinFetch` and `@Joins` (see README.md for the details)

v0.6.1
======

* added date inclusive specs

v0.6.0
======

* it is now allowed to annotate a custom interface that extends `Specification`, eg.:

  ```java
  @Or({
      @Spec(path="firstName", params="name", spec=Like.class),
      @Spec(path="lastName", params="name", spec=Like.class)
  })
  public interface FullNameSpec extends Specification<Customer> {
  }
  ```

  it can be then used as controller parameter without further annotations, i.e.:

  ```java
  @RequestMapping("/customers")
  @ResponseBody
  public Object findByFullName(FullNameSpec spec) {
      return repository.findAll(spec);
  }
  ```
* added optional `constVal` attribute in `@Spec`. It allows to define a constant part of the query that does not use any HTTP parameters, e.g.:
  
  ```java
  @And({
      @Spec(path="deleted", spec=Equal.class, constVal="false"),
	  @Spec(path="firstName", spec=Like.class)
  })
  ```
  for handling requests such as `GET /customers?firstName=Homer` and executing queries such as: `select c from Customer c where c.firstName like %Homer% and c.deleted = false`
* it is possible to combine parameter and interface annotations. They are combined with 'and' operator. For example you can create a basic interface like:

  ```java
  @Spec(path="deleted", spec=Equal.class, constVal="false")
  public interface NotDeletedEntitySpec<T> extends Specification<T> {}
  ```

  And use it for your queries in the controller:

  ```java
  @RequestMapping("/customers")
  @ResponseBody
  public Object findNotDeletedCustomerByLastName(
              @Spec(path="lastName", spec=Equal.class) NotDeletedEntitySpec<Customer> spec) {

      return repository.findAll(spec);
  }
  ```
* `Equal` and `In` now support boolean values correctly
* introduced `IsNull` specification
* introduced `@Conjunction` and `@Disjunction` for nesting ands and ors within each other

v0.5.0
======

* introduced `DateAfter` specification
* introduced `Equal` that supports exact match for numbers, strings, dates and enums
* introduced `In` that supports in operator for numbers, strings, dates and enums
* deprecated `EqualEnum` (use `Equal` and `In`)
